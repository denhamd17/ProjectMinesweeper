# Progress Updates



## Week 1

### What did your team do last week?
  
* We researched Minesweeper, and decided that we were going to do a 2-player version of the game through Peer-to-peer connection that
  establishes a constant communication between the two players throughout the game.

### What will your team do this week?
  
* We plan to agree on a design on how to implement the code so that each of us are on the same page on how we will code the game. We
  don't know yet if we'll have time this week to start coding, but we will at least know how we are going to implement 2-player
  functionality to Minesweeper.

### Any blocking issues/challenges need to be addressed?
 
* There hasn't been many issues or challenges regarding our project since we haven't started coding yet. So far, every team member has
  agreed on our goal to make a 2-player Minesweeper game. However, it is possible that we may run into several issues down the road as
  we start implementing the code, but we will hopefully address them accordingly should they happen.



## Week 2

### What did your team do last week?
  
* We continued our research on Minesweeper, and discussed on a design on how to implement the code so that we can start coding the game.
  We feel that we have a strong idea on how we will implement 2-player functionality to Minesweeper.

### What will your team do this week?
  
* We will begin to code the game whenever we meet up, and we will try to code on our own and collaborate via email or Discord to make sure our code is working. Hopefully, we can steadily make progress to finish the game within the time that we have to do it.

### Any blocking issues/challenges need to be addressed?
  * Because we still have not began coding yet, there are no major issues or challenges that need to addressed yet. That said, we may run into issues once we start coding the game, and we may even run into issues with our design. However, we are confident that we can address whatever issue comes our way.
  
  
## Week 3

### What did your team do last week?

* We began coding 2-player functionality to Minesweeper, and we are trying to make sure that we get the networking aspect of it working properly.

### What will your team do this week?

* We will try to finish up our 2-player functionality, add some graphics to the game to improve the interface, and hopefully continue collaborating via Discord, email, and meeting in person.

### Any blocking issues/challenges need to be addressed?
* As of writing this progress update, we are not totally finished with implementing 2-player functionality. That said, we are currently working to get that done as our top priority. We expect to be done with not only this goal, but also at least make progress in the rest of our code.

## Week 4

### What did your team do last week?

* We continued working on our 2-player functionality implementation, and we are working to making graphics for the game to improve the interface.

### What will your team do this week?

* We will try to finish our graphics coding this week, and get working on coding for the rest of our deliverables for the project. We will continue to collaborate via Discord, email, and meeting in person.

### Any blocking issues/challenges need to be addressed?
* We are still trying to figure out how to implement our other deliverables such as potentially adding the ability to show a bomb if the player knows where one is hiding, as well as potentially making each game between the 2 players be divided into rounds with the winner being the first to, for example, 2 wins in attempt to balance the pace each player might play.

## Week 5

### What did your team do last week?

* We continued working on networking and finished most of the graphical interface. At this point, we now have the game working to the point where it now needs more polishing and other additions such as a lobby system.

### What will your team do this week?

* We will finish up what needs to be done in order to get the game running for the demo this week. Any other details and minor deliverables we may add if there is time to add them. Finishing the networking aspect and making the game run properly is our top priority.

### Any blocking issues/challenges need to be addressed?

* Because we're still trying to get the lobby system to work, we have the challenge of addressing any errors that come our way when finishing the code. We're also facing the challenge of making other additions to the game if there is enough time for us to implement them.

Comments:

1. Make sure to follow ProgressUpdates template. This is a .md file as well, not just an arbitrary file. Try to follow the template strictly to make it more readable and presentable.

2. You need to start coding and speed up the process, too much discussion so far.
