Progress Update #1:
-What did your team do last week?
  We researched Minesweeper, and decided that we were going to do a 2-player version of the game through Peer-to-peer connection that
  establishes a constant communication between the two players throughout the game.
-What will your team do this week?
  We plan to agree on a design on how to implement the code so that each of us are on the same page on how we will code the game. We
  don't know yet if we'll have time this week to start coding, but we will at least know how we are going to implement 2-player
  functionality to Minesweeper.
-Any blocking issues/challenges need to be addressed?
  There hasn't been many issues or challenges regarding our project since we haven't started coding yet. So far, every team member has
  agreed on our goal to make a 2-player Minesweeper game. However, it is possible that we may run into several issues down the road as
  we start implementing the code, but we will hopefully address them accordingly should they happen.
