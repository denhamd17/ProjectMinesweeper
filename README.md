# ProjectMinesweeper

a. Project Name: Minesweeper

b. Description:

What: We are making our own version of the game Minesweeper with the main goal of making it a
2-player game. We are going to have 2 players compete on 2 different boards, and the winner of 
the two will be determined by who finishes their board first or whoever loses first doesn't win.

Why: This specific version of Minesweeper is one that we have never seen be implemented before, 
so our goal is to hopefully create what could be a great addition to the existing game.

How: The way we are thinking of accomplishing this is using Peer-to-Peer connection to connect 
both players to the game. Once connected, each player will have their own board and the program
will constantly check whether one player has either won or lost, and if one player achieves
either state, then the other player also receives the end code.

c. Deliverables: Ultimately, what we plan to deliver at the end of the semester is a 2-player
version of Minesweeper built using Peer-To-Peer connection and establishing constant 
communication between the 2 players throughout the game. 

d. Plan:

1. Week 1
- Research how our goal can be achieved, and what needs to be done.
2. Week 2
- Agree on a design to implement the code.
3. Week 3-5
-Implementing the code
4. Week 6
- Debugging, polishing if possible.

e. Team members: Camden Parsons, Giga Apkhaidze, Devin Denham

# Comments
1. Have a better formatting of the whole document. You can download the README.md template from Blackboard and follow the formatting
2. Write more details about the deliverables. Think about what you are going to demo in the final presentation and compile the list of features to be delivered accordingly
3. Be more specific on the plan for each week. For example, implementing the code is too vague. What features in particular you implement this week, etc.
